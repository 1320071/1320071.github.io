## About me

4th year BSc(Hons) Ethical Hacking at Abertay University and currently the president of the <a href="https://twitter.com/abertayfemsoc">Feminist society</a>. Outside of university I love art, Python 3 and my very fat cat. When I'm not attending Rocky I spend my free time doing small coding projects, drawing and making resin dice. I also really enjoy going to InfoSec conferences/CTFs/events (when there's not a global pandemic on) and I have been to; Cyber Re:coded 2018, BSides Glasgow 2018, the Scottish Universities Cyber Challenge 2019, Le Tour De Hack 2019, BSides Scotland 2019, BSides London 2019. I have also volunteered at Securi-tay 2018 and 2019 as well as BSides Manchester 2019.

#### Fun facts

- Can eat any food with chopsticks (apart from soup but I will give it a go) 
- Unashamed light mode user 
- Know a slightly concerning amount of Star Wars trivia

## Projects and Presentations


<h3>
 	Penetration Tests 
</h3>
<a href="https://supermairio.github.io/Whitepapers/Hacking1/">**Penetration Test on Virtual Machine Network** - 2018</a> 
For this assignment I was given a virtual network to map, attempt to exploit and then produce a report on my findings. This served as an introduction to Kali Linux, Metasploit, the CVE database as well as basic penetration testing scanning and analysis tools. This particular report also taught me how to assess a network and make recommendations to a client for security improvements. (A)

<a href="https://supermairio.github.io/Whitepapers/Networking2/">**Network Security Investigation** - 2019</a> 
As a part of my second Networking module I was provided with a server and a Kali Linux instance and asked to both map and assess the network. This gave me a much more in depth understanding of networking logic and topologies as I was required to create a network map. I also furthered my Linux command line understanding as well as  how to remotely access devices, get past firewalls on a network and mitigations for various security vulnerabilities. (B+)

<a href="https://supermairio.github.io/Whitepapers/Hacking2/"> **Web Application Security Investigation** - 2019 </a>
This project required me to perform an investigation on the security of a web application and create a report on my findings. Much like the other penetration tests I have done, this was focused on providing vulnerability proof of concepts and security recommendations for the 'client'. For this I learnt BurpSuite, ZAP and better improved my Linux command knowledge. Some of the vulnerabilities tested for and exploited were; SQL injection, XSS, CSRF and file inclusion. (A)


<h3>
 	Digital Forensics
</h3>
**'John Doe' Forensic Analysis** - 2019 
A group project as a part of my second year, the task is to create a Scottish court report of evidence gathered from a hard disk drive belonging to an accused ‘bird watcher’. The methodology involved using Sleuthkit, TestDisk and MetCam, as well as basic prefetch, registry and browser analysis. This has given me an understanding of a larger array of Linux command line and digital forensic tools. This is also where I learnt LaTeX. The investigation also gave me more experience on how to organise and work within a group. (A)

<a href="https://SuperMairio.github.io/Whitepapers/ForensicsReport">**Network Forensics Report** - 2020 </a>
An investigation of four PCAPs as part of a fictional forensics investigation surrounding bribery in a world chess-boxing competition. The methodology involved using Wireshark, KML, bash scripts; specifically the tool binwalk, and steganography tools. This gave me a much more in depth understanding of Wireshark and Network traffic as I had to locate specific packets, follow TCP streams and export data. One part involved the recreation of image files from multiple 'broken' jpeg files, giving me more practice with understanding magic numbers and file contents. (B+)

<a href="https://SuperMairio.github.io/Whitepapers/ForensicsEssay"> **Discussing How Manufacturers' Focus on Device Security Can Hinder Mobile Forensic Investigations** - 2020 </a>
An essay looking into the difficulties faced by forensic analysts when attempting to gather evidence from mobile devices. The areas I chose to look into were how manufacturers focusing on their users' security can make it far more difficult for criminal evidence to be extracted. This was my first essay and was good practice for my disertation, specifically the literature review and introduction sections. (B+)


<h3>
 	Web Applications
</h3>

**Visual Malware Analyser (ViMA)** - 2020
Another group project, done over two terms this time. For this one a web application to demonstrate the propagation of a worm through a network was created. The goal was to create a visualiser of the malware in order to act as an education tool. As such the webpage was made to be interactive and the 'worm' harmless to the network. The three main components consisted of; a Django and JavaScript visualiser that used the REST framework, a harmless worm that used Python 3 to propagate through a network using SSH and an 'anti-worm' that removed the original infection. This again helped to build up my soft skills, especially in communication. (A)

<a href="https://github.com/SuperMairio/SuperMairio.github.io"> **SuperMairio.github.io** - 2020 </a>
Created using Jekyll, mainly so I could use markdown; this is my website for my blog posts, programming notes and CV. Over the summer of 2020 I spent a lot of time working on the RockyBot saga and improving the CSS of my website. This will always be a work in progress but I love where it is now. Has helped me improve my CSS and JavaScript knowledge, especially when implementing the change theme button.

<a href="https://github.com/SuperMairio/Pi-Quiz.git"> **Pi Zero W Quiz Application** - 2021 </a>
This six part hand-in consisted of a Flask web application, an AWS RDS Postgresql database, a Pi Zero W LMK, a short report, a poster and a five-minute demonstration video.
The web application contained a short multiple choice quiz; where the user could enter a username which would be sent to the database and stored alongside their score. After the quiz ends the top ten scores would be displayed in descending order.
For the Pi aspect a kernel object was created and compiled using C in order to allow the Pi to interact with the LEDs on it's attatched breadboard.
(B+)

<h3>
	Facial Recognition Software
</h3>

<a href="https://supermairio.github.io/Whitepapers/MiniProject/">**An Analysis and Evaluation of Facial Recognition Software** - 2020 </a>
A mini-project for my third hacking module. This paper allowed me to delve deeper into FRS and investigate evasion techniques that can be used to fool them. I used an array of photographs with differing levels of face covering against Face++, Amazon's Rekognition and OpenCV. It was a really great experience to be able to do my own research into a topic I am very passionate about and I learnt a lot about how to conduct research, as well as time-management and self-organisation. (A+)

<a href="https://supermairio.github.io/talks/">**How to Evade Facial Recognition Software (talk)** - 2019 & 202? </a>
Done before my mini-project but also technically will happen after as well so I put it here. I gave this short talk at my Ethical Hacking society and was accepted on the Rookie Track of BSides London. Unfortunately the conference has been cancelled but I am still looking to give it at the next one, might even apply to do a full hour talk instead. This talk focuses on the basic concept of FRS, where it's being used and how some people try and evade it.

<h3>
	Docker
</h3>
<a href="https://github.com/SuperMairio/RockyBot/tree/discord-docker"> **RockyBot** - 2020 </a>
My coronavirus lockdown project where I created a Discord bot that sends my friends photos of my beautiful cat Rocky. Created using the Python 3 Discord library, then put in a Docker container and on AWS so I could have it running on the server 24/7. I wrote a three part blog on my progress and gave a short presentation about it to Abertay's <a href="https://twitter.com/AbertayHackers">Ethical Hacking society</a>.

**Escaping from a Virtualised Environment: An Evaluation of Container Breakout Techniques** - (ongoing)
This is my honours project. My goal with this is to investigate container-based virtualisation and the ease-of-exploitation of breakout techniques. For this I will be using Docker and looking into disabling namespacing, changing AppArmour profiles and exploiting CVEs. I also want to look into security measures that can be taken to prevent an attacker from breaking out of a container and into your host OS. 

<h3>
	Buffer Overflow
</h3>

<a href="https://supermairio.github.io/Whitepapers/ExploitTutorial/"> **Exploit Tutorial** - 2020 </a>
For this coursework I was required to create a tutorial that would walk someone through exploiting an array of vulnerabilities on a CoolPlayer music application. I used OllyDbg and Immunity in order to overflow the applications buffer with various Perl scripts so that I could execute shellcode. I managed to run calculator.exe, create a reverse shell, run an EggHunter script and create a ROP chain. This let me revise my Assembly knowledge as well as practice some basic Perl. I gained an understanding of how applications run and how buffer overflows can be exploited in order to run shellcode. (A+)
