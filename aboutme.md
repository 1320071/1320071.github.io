My name is Mairi but I also go by that one with the [insert colour] hair. I am currently a fourth year Ethical Hacking student and the president of the Feminist Society at Abertay University. I made this website so that I could make blogs and guides on various programming languages and projects that I do in my spare time. (Might also put my art on here at some point)


I've only been programming for ~seven years but in that time i've learnt a wide array of different languages and frameworks, both for education and as a hobby. I have decided the best way to explain my relationship to the languages and frameworks I know is through the medium of meme (memedium?):

I'm really interested in Digital Forensics and Web App testing and would love to eventually go into forensics or incident response. 
Outside of infosec and computing I do a lot of digital and pixel art.
I love doing almost anything arty and crafty and am currently trying out resin moulding, with the goals of making an RFID bracelet and my own keycaps.
